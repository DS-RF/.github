## Delta Science Institute


Delta Science, the U.S. nonprofit research institute in academy (Federal Tax ID: 92-1618476), provides basic research in physics and chemistry. 

The developing topics are 

-  Electrochemistry of fuel cells for Green Energetics;
-  Magnetic phenomena of single-molecule magnets for Qubits applications;
-  semiconductor engineering for electronics by manipulating defects in solid-states, creating Schottky contact, and studying Nuclear Magnetic (NMR) and Electronic Paramagnetic Resonances (EPR);
-  design nonlinear materials for optoelectronic applications. 

To investigate phenomena we use first-principal theoretical methods 

Density Functional Theory (DFT);
GW approximation; 
Bethe-Salpeter approach;
perturbation theory; 
ab-initio molecular dynamics.

You can request to modify any developed software according to your organization needs.
