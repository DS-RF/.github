## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Delta Science, the U.S. nonprofit research institute in academy (Federal Tax ID: 92-1618476), provides basic research in physics and chemistry. 

The developing topics are 

Electrochemistry of fuel cells for Green Energetics;
Magnetic phenomena of single-molecule magnets for Qubits applications;
Semiconductor engineering for electronics by manipulating defects in solid-states, creating Schottky contact, and studying Nuclear Magnetic (NMR) and Electronic Paramagnetic Resonances (EPR);
design nonlinear materials for optoelectronic applications. 

To investigate phenomena we use first-principal theoretical methods 

Density Functional Theory (DFT);
GW approximation; 
Bethe-Salpeter approach;
perturbation theory; 
ab-initio molecular dynamics.

You can request to modify any developed software according to your organization needs.
